          <h2>My enjoyment on 2XKO</h2>

          <p>My experience playing 2xko has been a joyful start ever since it came out. At first I wasn't interested in the game until my friend managed to give me an invite to the closed beta. At first I was not phased since I did not enjoy playing the game in the last playtest. My mind quickly changed the moment I started to play Vi. She's a rushdown character with high/unique mobility options through her sway. But the best part of her kit is her electrics. If she times the attack of her sways, she can release a perfect electric which is used to deal more damage and keep her combos going.</p>

          <p>My other favorite character is blitzkrank, He is a grappler that does alot of damage of his grabs and can build a unique bar that upgrades his special moves once fully charged. When putting these characters together, they become a very fun and unstoppable team using the double down fuze. Vi is able to keep her combos going even longer thanks to blitzkranks grabs which put the opponent in a standing position allowing for you to go for a reset or keep the combo going. Overall this team has been amazing for me and will keep playing going forword.</p>

          <h2>My disappointment on the NBA Finals</h2>

          <p>If you've been watching the nba playoffs last year, then you probably the know the disappointing end that was brought to the finals. After watching the pistons lose to the knicks, I moved on to the other teams since I knew they were just building themselves up from the ground since they were awful the past decade. But what moved me the most in the playoffs was the Indiana Pacers. This team has brought so much excitement and rivalries against other teams as they were seen as undergrounds with know superstar player. This changed when Tyrese Haliburton brought his team all the way to the finals by beating the Bucks that have the greatest PF in the league, Giannis Antetokounmpo, then the number 1 seeded Cavaliers, and lastly the Knicks that have a supers teamed roster. Tyrese showed his excellence as he has beaten these team with multiple game winning and tie breaking shots that brought in new fans of the team, including me, along for the ride. They then faced their final opponent which was the Oklahoma City Thunder, considered as the best team in the league with their MVP superstar, Shai-Gilgeous Alexander. The game became close as they went back to back until game 7. My disappointment showed the moment game 7 happened when Haliburton fell to the ground with a torn ACL. This left me devastated as he was going on a hot-streak that made people believe they were going to win.</p>
